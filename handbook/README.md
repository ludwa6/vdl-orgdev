# handbook — the Governance Handbook

**The Markdown files in this directory are the Handbook.** Not a copy of it, not an export of it —
the document itself. Everything else is generated from them.

> **Changed on 2026-08-20.** Until that date the `.pages` files were the source and this directory
> held read-only exports. That is now reversed. The reason is in §*Why it was inverted* below; the
> practical consequence is that **an edit made to a `.pages` file no longer reaches the Handbook.**

## What is here

| | |
|---|---|
| `pt/*.md` | The **definitive** Portuguese Handbook. This is the source. |
| `en/*.md` | The English Handbook — a translation of the Portuguese, human-accepted, not machine-refreshed |
| `pt/*.docx`, `en/*.docx` | **Generated.** Produced by `scripts/md2docx.py`. Do not edit |
| `en/00_*.md` | Working notes about the translation, not Handbook documents |

**The Portuguese wins.** Where the two language sets disagree, the Portuguese is the governance
document and the English is a translation of it.

## The rule

> **Change the Markdown. Regenerate the rest. Never edit a generated file.**

```
handbook/pt/*.md  ──scripts/md2docx.py──▶  .docx  ──Pages, by hand──▶  .pages / .pdf
       │
       └─ the source: what a Governance Meeting adopts, what git diffs, what the map is checked against
```

To produce the whole set after an accepted revision:

```
python3 scripts/md2docx.py --all
scripts/handbook-roundtrip.sh          # proves the .docx lost nothing
```

`.pages` and `.pdf` stay a manual step: open the `.docx` in Pages and export. Pages has no
scriptable *export as Pages* verb, so nobody has automated that leg and nobody should pretend to.

## Two checks worth running

**`scripts/handbook-parity.sh <pt-term> [en-term]`** — the Handbook is one document in two
languages, and an edit applied to `pt/` and not to `en/` is an edit that has not landed. This makes
"applied in both languages" something you run rather than something you remember. It exists because
on 2026-08-15 the restaurant-name correction went into the Portuguese only, was reported as done,
and stood wrong for five days.

**`scripts/handbook-roundtrip.sh`** — renders every `.docx` back to markdown and compares. Content
must match exactly; blank-line placement may differ. Run it after touching either converter, and
before sending a `.docx` to a person.

## Why it was inverted

The old arrangement had a real reason: Nita authors in Apple Pages, and `.pages` is a zip of
compressed protobuf that git can store but cannot diff. Exporting to Markdown gave the question
*"what did document 05 say in June?"* an answer it never had before.

What it could not give was a **single** source. A document that is authored in one place and
recorded in another has two states, and the two drift — which is the failure this repo's one rule
exists to prevent, and which had already happened: on 2026-08-15 a correction reached the Portuguese
set and not the English one.

Making Markdown the source resolves that, and buys three things:

- **Governance decisions and documents move through the same door.** A change from a Governance
  Meeting and a change typed into GitHub are the same kind of change, reviewable the same way.
- **Every format becomes an output.** `.docx` for people who want Word, `.pages` for Nita, `.pdf`
  for printing and circulation — all generated, never separately maintained.
- **The enumerated sections can eventually be generated from Notion.** Domains, Accountabilities
  and Policies live in Notion (Tier 3) and are hand-copied here today. That is the next drift
  waiting to happen, and it can only be closed once the target is a text file.

## The consequence, stated plainly

**Nita's editing route changes, and that is a people question, not a technical one.** Her `.pages`
files are now outputs. If she keeps editing them, the Handbook has two sources again and the drift
returns.

The route that works today, and the one this round used: **she reviews and comments on a document,
and her comments are applied to the Markdown.** She keeps the tool she knows; the repo keeps one
source. Editing directly on GitHub is the eventual target, after the training — not a prerequisite
for it.

## What this is not

It is **not** the structure. Circles, Roles, Domains, Accountabilities, Policies and who fills what
live in Notion and change at every Governance Meeting — see the three tiers in the repository
README. The Handbook is the narrative layer: Purpose, Values, how we work, the glossary, and the
Policies the organisation has adopted.
