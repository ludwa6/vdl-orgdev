# handbook-parity.sh — checks a term across both language sets.
#
# The Handbook is one document in two languages. A change applied to
# handbook/pt/ and not to handbook/en/ is a change that has not landed,
# and the failure is silent: both files parse, both render, and the
# commit message says the work is done.
#
# On 2026-08-15 the restaurant-name correction went into the Portuguese
# set only. Nobody noticed for five days, and what surfaced it was a
# person re-reading the document for an unrelated reason.
#
# Run before any commit that claims a set-wide edit:
#
#   scripts/handbook-parity.sh ama
#   scripts/handbook-parity.sh 'Horta ao Prato' 'Garden to Plate'
#
# With one argument, the same term is counted in both sets. With two,
# the first is the Portuguese term and the second its English
# counterpart — the usual case, since the sets are a translation pair.
